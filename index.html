                        Large-scale and rapid 3D reconstruction of urban areas holds significant
                        practical value. Recently, methods that reconstruct buildings from off-nadir
                        imagery have gained attention for their po-tential to meet the demand for
                        large-scale, time-sensitive reconstruction applications. These methods
                        typically estimate the building height and footprint position by extracting
                        building roof and the roof-to-footprint offset within a single off-nadir
                        image. However, the reconstruction ac-curacy of these methods is primarily
                        constrained by two issues: first, errors in the single-view building
                        detection, and second, the inaccurate extraction of offsets, which is often
                        a consequence of these detection errors as well as interference from shadow
                        occlusion. To address these chal-lenge, we propose DualRecon, a method for
                        3D building reconstruction from heterogeneous dual-view remote sensing
                        imagery. In contrast to single-image detection methods, DualRecon achieves
                        more accurate 3D information extraction for reconstruction by fusing and
                        correlating building information across different views. This success can be
                        attributed to three key ad-vantages of DualRecon. First, DualRecon fuses the
                        two input views and extracts building objects based on the fused image
                        features, thereby improving the accuracy of building detection and
                        localization. Second, compared to the roof-to-footprint offset, the
                        disparity offset of the same rooftop between different views is less
                        affected by interference from shadows and occlusions. Our method leverages
                        this disparity offset to determine building height, which enhances the
                        accuracy of height estimation. Third, we designed DualRecon with a
                        three-branch architecture to be op-timally tailored for the dual-view 3D
                        information extraction task. Third, we designed DualRecon with a
                        three-branch architecture to be optimally tailored for the dual-view 3D
                        information ex-traction task. Moreover, this paper introduces
                        BuildingDualâ€”the first large-scale dual-view 3D building reconstruction
                        dataset. It comprises 3,789 image pairs containing 288,787 building
                        in-stances, where each instance is annotated with its respective roofs in
                        both views, roof-to-footprint offset, footprint, and the disparity offset of
                        the roof. Experiments on this dataset demonstrate that DualRecon achieves
                        more accurate reconstruction results than existing methods when perform-ing
                        3D building reconstruction from dual-view remote sensing imagery.
